# Integrations

## When to use

Use this when the user needs HTTP services, REST clients, web services, file
exchange, message queues, webhooks, or OpenSpec-backed integration changes.

Do not start with transport code. First identify the business object, data
contract, error handling policy, authentication requirements, and where the
integration belongs in the 1C architecture.

## Primary path

- Use metadata tools to inspect or create HTTP services, common modules,
  constants, catalogs, documents, and registers needed by the integration.
- Use BSL source edits for modules and handlers.
- Use `v8-runner` `operation=syntax` and relevant tests after changes.
- For OpenSpec work, keep proposal/spec artifacts in the project’s chosen spec
  workspace and link implementation tasks to those artifacts.

## Standards to apply

- Set connection and read timeouts explicitly.
- Normalize external payloads at the boundary.
- Keep secrets in local config or secure storage, not committed source files.
- Log enough context to diagnose failures without logging credentials or full
  personal data payloads.
